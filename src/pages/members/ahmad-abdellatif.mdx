# Ahmad Abdellatif

I am a postdoctoral researcher at DASLab in the department of computer science and software engineering at Concordia University. I received my Ph.D. degree in Software Engineering from Concordia University under [Dr. Emad Shihab](/members/emad-shihab) supervision. I obtained my master’s degree in Software Engineering from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM). My research interests cover a wide range of software engineering related topics including software bots, chatbots, software quality, and mining software repositories.
