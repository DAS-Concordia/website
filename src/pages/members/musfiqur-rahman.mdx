# Musfiqur Rahman

I am a Software Engineering PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University, Montreal under Dr. Emad Shihab’s supervision. I obtained a research-based Master degree in Computer Science from the same university in 2018 under the supervision of Dr. Peter Rigby and my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [East West University](https://www.ewubd.edu/), Bangladesh in 2014. My primary research interest is Software Engineering. More specifically, my research focuses on <strong>Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence (SE4AI)</strong>.
