# Hassan Khatoonabadi

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University under [Dr. Emad Shihab](/members/emad-shihab) supervision. I received my master's and bachelor's degrees in computer science from University of Tabriz and Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, respectively.

My general research area is Software Engineering. Particularly, I am interested in Code Review, Mining Software Repositories, Empirical Software Engineering, and Software Analytics. I apply Data Mining, Statistical Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques on historical software data to understand the challenges and facilitate collaboration in software development.
