# Diego Elias Costa

I was a postdoctoral researcher at the DAS Lab at the [Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng.html),  
at Concordia University. Previously, I was a doctoral researcher in the [Parallel and Distributed Systems Group](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/home/), at Heidelberg University where I obtained my Ph.D. degree.

My research interests cover a wide range of software engineering and performance engineering related topics, including mining software repositories, empirical software engineering, performance testing, memory-leak detection, and adaptive data structures.
