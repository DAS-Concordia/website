# Jo達o Pedro de Souza Olivo Tardivo

I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in Brazil and have joined Concordia University's DAS Lab as a research intern through the Mitacs Globalink program. Under the supervision of Alor Ebube, my research primarily involves Large Language Models (LLMs) and intelligent agents. My academic interests extend broadly within artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I am eager to contribute to innovative research at the intersection of these dynamic fields.
