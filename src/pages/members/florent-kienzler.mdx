# Florent Kienzler

I am an engineering student at the Department of Computer Science at CY-TECH in France.
I'm currently in apprenticeship, so I'm also working for Trapil as a Software Engineer.
To complete my diploma, I had to get a job experience abroad. Thanks to MITACS, I've been able to work in DAS Lab during 12 weeks. I have been able to see how works a research lab.
