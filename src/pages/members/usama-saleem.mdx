## About Me

I am an Undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Concordia University. Currently, I am working as an Assistant AI Researcher at the DAS Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Emad Shihab. My primary focus is on the application and use of generative pretrained transformers to interact with GitHub repositories using natural language and vector databases.
In my role as an Assistant AI Researcher, I am involved in developing webapps that leverage natural language processing techniques. I collaborate with a team of researchers and engineers to explore the potential of generative pretrained transformers in automating various tasks related to GitHub repositories. By utilizing advanced machine learning models, we aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of software development processes, enabling developers to interact with repositories through intuitive and human-like conversations.

Additionally, I also work as an AI Engineer at Matrox, where I contribute to the development of AI-powered solutions. In this role, I participate in the design and implementation of cutting-edge algorithms and architectures to solve complex problems in computer vision and machine learning.
Furthermore, I am also involved as a Developer at HP, a global technology company known for its advancements in hardware and software solutions. In this capacity, I work on developing internal tools that facilitate efficient workflows and streamline processes. Using technologies like React and Next.js, I design and build user-friendly applications that improve productivity and collaboration among team members.

Through my combined experiences, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of software engineering and artificial intelligence.
I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI and software engineering, and I constantly seek to expand my knowledge and skills through continuous learning and exploration of emerging technologies. By combining my academic background, research experience, and industry involvement, I strive to make meaningful contributions to the field and drive innovation in AI-driven software development.
