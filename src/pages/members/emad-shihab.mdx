# Emad Shihab

I am a Full Professor and Concordia Research Chair in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University. My general research area is Software Engineering. I am particularly interested in Mining Software Repositories, Software Quality Assurance, Software Maintenance, Empirical Software Engineering, Mobile/wearable Applications and Software Architecture. I mine historical project data and apply Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence and Statistical Analysis techniques in order to build pragmatic solutions that practitioners can use to maximize their software quality with the least amount of resources. Some of my research has been done in collaboration with and/or adopted in industry by companies such as Avaya, Microsoft, BlackBerry and Ericsson.
