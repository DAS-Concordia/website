#  Laurine Menneron
I'm Laurine Menneron, a 3-month intern at DAS Lab. I'm from France, where I'm studying computer engineering at CESI. I'm mainly studying web development and artificial intelligence systems thanks to my apprenticeship at Infotel Conseil (Nantes, France) which started in October 2022.
